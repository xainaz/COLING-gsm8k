        "input": "Please return only the number, with no symbols or other punctuation.The cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices and the pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices.  If Kate\u2019s 6 friends each eat 6 cheese pizza slices and 4 pepperoni pizza slices, how many pizza pies does she need to buy?",
        "output": "To find the total number of pizza pies Kate needs to buy, we need to calculate the total number of slices her friends will eat and divide that by the number of slices per pizza. Since each friend eats 6 cheese pizza slices and there are 12 slices per cheese pizza, the total number of cheese pizzas needed is (6 friends * 6 slices) / 12 slices per pizza = 3 pizzas. Since each friend eats 4 pepperoni pizza slices and there are 8 slices per pepperoni pizza, the total number of pepperoni pizzas needed is (6 friends * 4 slices) / 8 slices per pizza = 3 pizzas. Therefore, Kate needs to buy 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas, for a total of 6 pizzas.",
