    "question": "Mike decides he wants to replace his movie collection with digital versions.  He has 600 movies.  A third of the movies are in various series and he knows he can get those for only $6 of the cost of a normal movie by just buying the series together.  40% of the remaining movies are older movies which are $5.  How much does replacing the movies cost if a normal movie costs $10?",
