    "question": "There are 10000 gallons of water in a pool. Using a water pump, Anthony and his father fill a tank with half the amount of water in the pool. They use water from the tank to water their vegetable garden. If the tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons of water per day, how many gallons of water will be remaining in the tank after 6 days?",
