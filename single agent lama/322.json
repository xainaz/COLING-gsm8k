        "input": "Please return only the number, with no symbols or other punctuation.Jam has three boxes full of pencils and 2 loose pencils which give a total of 26 pencils. If her sister, Meg, has 46 pencils, how many boxes do Jam and Meg need to store all their pencils?",
        "output": "To find the number of boxes needed, we first need to find the number of pencils in each box. Since Jam has 3 boxes and 2 loose pencils, which give a total of 26 pencils, we can find the number of pencils in each box by subtracting the loose pencils from the total and dividing by the number of boxes. 26 - 2 = 24, 24 / 3 = 8. So each box can hold 8 pencils. Jam and Meg have a total of 26 + 46 = 72 pencils. To find the number of boxes needed, we divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils each box can hold. 72 / 8 = 9. So Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils.",
