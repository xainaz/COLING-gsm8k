        "output": "There are 5 students good at math only and the rest are good at both math and English. Since there are 20 students in total, 5 are good at math only, and 8 are good at English only, the number of students good at both is 20 - 5 - 8 = 7. So the total number of students good at math is 5 + 7 = 12.",
