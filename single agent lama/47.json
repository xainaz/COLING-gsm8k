        "output": "To find the total amount spent on ties, we first need to calculate the number of blue ties and the cost of red ties. Since John spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each, the number of blue ties is 200 / 40 = 5. Since John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties is 2 * 5 = 10. The red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, so the cost of a red tie is 40 * 1.5 = 60. The total amount spent on red ties is 10 * 60 = 600. Therefore, the total amount spent on ties is 200 + 600 = 800.",
