        "output": "Let's break down the information. Last night, Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars. Today, he killed three times as many wolves as cougars. Let's denote the number of cougars he killed today as x. Then the number of wolves he killed today is 3x. We also know that he killed three fewer cougars than the previous night, so x = 15 - 3 = 12. Therefore, the number of wolves he killed today is 3 * 12 = 36. In total, Rick killed 10 + 15 + 36 + 12 = 73 animals.",
