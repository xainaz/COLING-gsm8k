        "output": "Let's set up the equation 3x + 5(x + 2) = 42. This equation can be solved to find the value of x, which represents the number of red chickens. To solve for x, we can start by distributing the 5 to the terms inside the parentheses: 3x + 5x + 10 = 42. Combine like terms: 8x + 10 = 42. Subtract 10 from both sides: 8x = 32. Divide both sides by 8: x = 4.",
