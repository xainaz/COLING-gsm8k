        "input": "Please return only the number, with no symbols or other punctuation.It is approximately 1955 kilometers from San Diego, California to New York City, New York. If Bernice drove 325 kilometers for 4 days, how many kilometers will she still need to drive?",
        "output": "To find the total kilometers Bernice needs to drive, we first need to find the total kilometers she drove in 4 days. Since she drove 325 kilometers per day for 4 days, we multiply 325 by 4 to get the total kilometers she drove. 325 * 4 = 1300. Now we subtract the total kilometers she drove from the total kilometers of the trip. 1955 - 1300 = 655. So Bernice will still need to drive 655 kilometers.",
