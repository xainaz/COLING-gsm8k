        "output": "To find the grams of protein John gets per week, we need to calculate the grams of protein he gets per day first. Since a cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams and has 3 grams of protein, we can calculate the protein per gram as 3/100 = 0.03 grams of protein per gram of mushrooms. If John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day, he gets 200 * 0.03 = 6 grams of protein per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, John gets 6 * 7 = 42 grams of protein per week.",
