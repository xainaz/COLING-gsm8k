    "question": "Tyson decided to make muffaletta sandwiches for the big game.  Each sandwich required 1 pound each of meat and cheese and would serve 4 people.  There would be 20 people in total watching the game.  The meat cost $7.00 per pound and the cheese cost $3.00 per pound.  How much money would he spend on the meat and cheese to make enough sandwiches to serve 20 people?",
