    "question": "Jerry has two pools, both with leaks emptying them out at 4 gallons/minute. 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. Now the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. How much water does the small pool have now?",

Now the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. How much water does the small pool have now?",
        "output": "We need to set up an equation based on the information given. Let's denote the initial amount of water in the small pool as x gallons. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago, the big pool had 2x gallons. Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. We also know that both pools are leaking at 4 gallons/minute.",
