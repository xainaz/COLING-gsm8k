    "question": "Mr. Maxim works at The Best Cookeries Around restaurant. On a particular day, 50 people entered the restaurant in the morning to eat. At around 10:00, 40 more people entered the restaurant and ordered the same amount of food as the first people. After a while, twice the number of people who entered the restaurant at 10:00 came in and ordered lunch. By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered the restaurant. Calculate the total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day.",
