She also adds 20cm to the bottom of the dress with a lace trim. If the final design is 140cm long then how long, in centimeters, was the dress in its original design?",

She also adds 20cm to the bottom of the dress with a lace trim. If the final design is 140cm long then how long, in centimeters, was the dress in its original design?",
        "output": "To find the original length of the dress, we need to reverse the operations that Shania performed. We know that the final length of the dress is 140cm, and that this is 50% longer than the original length, plus an additional 20cm. Let's denote the original length as x. Then, the final length is 1.5x + 20. Since the final length is 140cm, we can set up the equation 1.5x + 20 = 140. Solving for x, we get x = (140 - 20) / 1.5 = 80.",
