Kris kept 9 of the stickers and gave the remaining 7 stickers to Rob. How many stickers did Seth have in the beginning?",
        "output": "Let's denote the number of stickers Seth had in the beginning as x. Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, so Luis got x/2 stickers. Luis used half of the stickers, so he used (x/2)/2 = x/4 stickers. Luis gave the rest to Kris, so Kris got x/2 - x/4 = x/4 stickers. Kris kept 9 stickers and gave the remaining 7 stickers to Rob, so Kris had 9 + 7 = 16 stickers. Since Kris had x/4 stickers, we can set up the equation x/4 = 16. Solving for x, we get x = 16 * 4 = 64.",
