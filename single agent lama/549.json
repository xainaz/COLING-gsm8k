How many toys does Jonathan currently have?",
        "output": "Let's denote the number of toys Jonathan currently has as x. Since James has 80 toys, five times larger than James's play set would be 5 * 80 = 400 toys. Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he already has to have enough toys to make a sorted play set five times larger than James's play set, so we can set up the equation x + 2 = 400. Solving for x, we get x = 398.",
