        "output": "First, let's calculate the total number of clients Kim will have. He already has 3 clients and is talking to 5 more potential clients. So, the total number of clients will be 3 + 5 = 8. Each client will need 2 bottles of bleach and a pack of cloths to clean. The cost of 2 bottles of bleach will be 2 * $2 = $4 and the cost of a pack of cloths will be $5. So, the total cost for each client will be $4 + $5 = $9. The total expenses for 8 clients will be 8 * $9 = $72. The total income each week will be $92. Profit is the difference between total income and total expenses, so the profit will be $92 - $72 = $20.",
