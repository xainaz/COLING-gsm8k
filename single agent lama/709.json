        "output": "The ice cream factory makes 100 quarts of chocolate ice cream in 2 hours, so it makes 100 / 2 = 50 quarts per hour. In 48 hours, it would make 50 * 48 = 2400 quarts of chocolate ice cream. The factory makes 50 quarts of vanilla ice cream in 4 hours, so it makes 50 / 4 = 12.5 quarts per hour. In 48 hours, it would make 12.5 * 48 = 600 quarts of vanilla ice cream. In total, the factory would make 2400 + 600 = 3000 quarts of ice cream in 48 hours.",
