    "question": "Mr. Jackson\u2019s fourth-grade class has 27 students. He wants to give each student 2 glue sticks. The glue sticks come in packs of 8. How many packs will Mr. Jackson need to buy so every student can have 2 glue sticks, assuming he can only buy whole packs and he expects to have some extra glue sticks left over?",
