She makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. If Carly's class has five people and each person gets two treats, how many cupcakes did Carly make?",
        "output": "To find the number of cupcakes Carly made, we need to set up an equation based on the given information. Let's denote the number of cupcakes as x. Since Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes, the number of brownies is 3x - 2. Each person gets two treats, and there are five people in the class, so the total number of treats is 2 * 5 = 10. The total number of treats is the sum of cupcakes and brownies, so we can set up the equation x + (3x - 2) = 10.",
