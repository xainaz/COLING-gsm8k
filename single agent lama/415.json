    "question": "While Joanne is gathering apples from her family\u2019s orchard, her sister comes outside to help her. Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees, half this amount from the shortest trees, and more apples from the average trees. Compared with Joanne, her sister gathers twice as many apples from the tallest trees and 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees. She doesn't take any from the average trees. If the sisters have gathered a combined total of 500 apples, how many apples did Joanne gather from the average trees?",

        "output": "Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathered from the average trees as x. We know that Joanne gathered 30 apples from the tallest trees and half this amount from the shortest trees, which is 15 apples. Her sister gathered twice as many apples from the tallest trees, which is 60 apples, and 3 times as many apples from the shortest trees, which is 45 apples. The total number of apples gathered by both sisters is 500. So the equation is 30 + 15 + x + 60 + 45 = 500. Simplifying the equation, we get x + 150 = 500. Solving for x, we get x = 350.",
