        "output": "To find the number of slices each person can have, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people. There are 7 pizzas with 8 slices each, so the total number of slices is 7 * 8 = 56. There are 4 people, including Henry. So, the number of slices each person can have is 56 / 4 = 14.",
