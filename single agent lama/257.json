        "output": "The redwood weighs 56000 pounds. First, calculate the total weight of the redwood: 200 feet * 400 pounds/10 feet = 8000 pounds * 7 = 56000 pounds. Then, calculate the weight of the wood eaten by termites: 56000 pounds * 0.3 = 16800 pounds. Subtract the weight of the wood eaten by termites from the total weight: 56000 pounds - 16800 pounds = 39200 pounds.",
