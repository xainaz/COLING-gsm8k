        "output": "First, let's find the height of Anne. Since Albert is 36\" tall and Anne is twice the size of Albert, Anne is 36 * 2 = 72\" tall. Since Jackie is 2\" shorter than Anne, Jackie is now 72 - 2 = 70\" tall. Since Jackie grew 3\" over the summer, Jackie was 70 - 3 = 67\" tall before summer.",
