        "output": "We need to set up equations based on the given information. Let's denote Ruby's age as r and Sam's age as s. We know that Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, so we can write the equation r = 6s. We also know that in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam, so we can write the equation r + 9 = 3(s + 9).",
