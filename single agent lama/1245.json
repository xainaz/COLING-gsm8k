        "output": "Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as 's'. The number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, which is 5s - 4. The total number of ice cubes is 116. So the equation is s + 5s - 4 = 116. Combining like terms, we get 6s - 4 = 116. Adding 4 to both sides, we get 6s = 120. Dividing both sides by 6, we get s = 20. So the number of blueberry cubes is 5s - 4 = 5 * 20 - 4 = 96.",
