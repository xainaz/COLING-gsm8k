    "question": "Shawnda decides that her neighborhood kids could really use a bike inflation service. She decides the best way to charge is by the tire. Each tire costs 25 cents to inflate. On the first day, 5 people on bicycles came by to get both tires inflated. 3 people came by to get all their tricycle tires inflated. Finally, one person actually came by on a unicycle. How many dollars did she make that day?",
