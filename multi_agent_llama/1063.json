James gets 80 emails a day, and 20% of those emails don't require any response. So, the number of emails James responds to in a day is 80 * 0.8 = 64. Then, we can calculate the total number of emails James responds to in a 5-day work week by multiplying the daily number by 5. Please use the python_repl tool to execute the following code:\n\n```python\n# Define variables\ntotal_emails_per_day = 80\npercentage_of_emails_requiring_response = 0.8\ndays_in_work_week = 5\n\n# Calculate the number of emails James responds to in a day\nemails_per_day = total_emails_per_day * percentage_of_emails_requiring_response\n\n# Calculate the total number of emails James responds to in a 5-day work week\ntotal_emails = emails_per_day * days_in_work_week\n\n# Print the total number of emails\nprint(total_emails)\n```')",
