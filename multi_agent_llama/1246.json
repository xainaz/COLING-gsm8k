However, I can still provide the correct Python code to calculate the total number of games and proceed with the rest of the steps.\n\nHere's the correct Python code to calculate the total number of games:\n```python\n# Define variables\ngames_per_year = 40\nyears = 4\n\n# Calculate total games\ntotal_games = games_per_year * years\n\n# Print total games\nprint(total_games)\n```\nThis code should output: `160`\n\nNow, let's proceed with the next step. To calculate the total number of points Ara has scored in four years, we need to multiply the total number of games by her score per game.\n\n```python\n# Define variables\ntotal_games = 160\nscore_per_game = 21\n\n# Calculate total points\ntotal_points = total_games * score_per_game\n\n# Print total points\nprint(total_points)\n```\nThis code should output: `3360`\n\nTherefore, the total number of points Ara has scored in four years is `3360`.",
