    "question": "Marcel runs a bicycle store. His main products are three types of bikes: MTB, BMX, and Trekking. The price of one MTB is $500, BMX is half the price of an MTB, and a Trekking bike is $450. In one month, Marcel sold a total of 300 bikes among the types listed. Half of them were Trekking bikes, and 15% were BMX bikes. The rest of the sold bikes were MTB type. How much did Marcel earn from selling bicycles during that month?",

If you want to see the output of a value, you should print it out with `print(...)`. \n\nFor example, you can use the following python command:\n```python\n# Define the number of bikes sold for each type\ntrekking_bikes_sold = 150\nbmx_bikes_sold = 45\nmtb_bikes_sold = 105\n\n# Define the price of each type of bike\nmtb_price = 500\nbmx_price = mtb_price / 2\ntrekking_price = 450\n\n# Calculate the earnings from selling each type of bike\ntrekking_earnings = trekking_bikes_sold * trekking_price\nbmx_earnings = bmx_bikes_sold * bmx_price\nmtb_earnings = mtb_bikes_sold * mtb_price\n\n# Calculate the total earnings\ntotal_earnings = trekking_earnings + bmx_earnings + mtb_earnings\n\n# Print the total earnings\nprint(total_earnings)\n```'')",
