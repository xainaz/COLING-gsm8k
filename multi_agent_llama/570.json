Since Peter spent an equal amount each day for one week and he spent money on wooden action figures from Sunday through Wednesday, we can calculate the amount spent on wooden action figures as follows:\n\nPeter has $70 and he spent money for 4 days on wooden action figures. Since he spent an equal amount each day, we can calculate the amount spent per day as $70 / 7 = $10 per day. The total amount spent on wooden action figures is $10 * 4 = $40.\n\nHowever, we need to write python code to calculate this amount. Please use the python_repl tool to execute the following python command:\n\n```python\n# Define variables\ntotal_money = 70\ndays_spent_on_wooden_figures = 4\ndays_in_a_week = 7\n\n# Calculate the amount spent per day\namount_spent_per_day = total_money / days_in_a_week\n\n# Calculate the total amount spent on wooden action figures\ntotal_amount_spent_on_wooden_figures = amount_spent_per_day * days_spent_on_wooden_figures\n\n# Print the total amount spent on wooden action figures\nprint(total_amount_spent_on_wooden_figures)\n```')",
