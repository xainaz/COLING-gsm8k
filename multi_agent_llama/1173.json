        "input": "Please return only the number, with no symbols or other punctuation.A regular box of 100 dishwasher pods costs $12. There's currently a special size box for the same price that has 20% more pods. How many dishwashing cycles with the new box can you run for $1 if you use 1 pod per cycle?",
        "output": "To solve the problem, we need to calculate the number of pods in the special size box and then determine how many dishwashing cycles can be run for $1.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of pods in the special size box. Since it has 20% more pods than the regular box, we can calculate the number of pods as follows:\n\nNumber of pods in regular box = 100\nNumber of pods in special size box = 100 + (20% of 100)\n= 100 + (0.20 x 100)\n= 100 + 20\n= 120\n\nNow, let's calculate the cost per pod in the special size box:\n\nCost of special size box = $12\nNumber of pods in special size box = 120\nCost per pod = $12 / 120\n= $0.10 per pod\n\nSince each cycle uses 1 pod, the cost per cycle is also $0.10. To find out how many cycles can be run for $1, we can divide $1 by the cost per cycle:\n\nNumber of cycles per $1 = $1 / $0.10\n= 10\n\nTherefore, the answer is 10.",
