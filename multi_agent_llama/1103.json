    "question": "A jellyfish tank has numerous jellyfish in it. A fifth of the jellyfish are large, and a third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light. The other jellyfish are small and always stay blue. When a UV light turned on, 6 jellyfish changed color. How many jellyfish are in the tank?",
