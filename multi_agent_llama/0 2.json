    "input": "Janet\u2019s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?",
    "output": "To solve the problem, we need to calculate the number of eggs Janet sells at the farmers' market daily and then multiply it by the price per egg.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of eggs laid by Janet's ducks per day: 16 eggs.\n\nNext, let's calculate the total number of eggs Janet uses for breakfast and baking muffins: 3 (breakfast) + 4 (muffins) = 7 eggs.\n\nNow, let's subtract the number of eggs used from the total number of eggs laid to find the number of eggs sold at the farmers' market: 16 (total eggs) - 7 (eggs used) = 9 eggs.\n\nFinally, let's multiply the number of eggs sold by the price per egg to find the daily earnings: 9 eggs * $2 per egg = $18.\n\nSo, Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market.",
