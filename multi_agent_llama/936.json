    "question": "A hotel in the Philippines charges 1000 pesos for a 12-hour stay or 1600 pesos for a 24-hour stay. After 12 hours, visitors have the option to add 70 pesos for every additional hour. Cameron arrives at 5 pm at the hotel and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning. He decides to go with the option of adding on 70 pesos for every hour after the 12-hour mark instead of paying for 24 hours. How much money would Cameron save?",
