We have already defined the total number of cases as 250 and the ratio of the first house to the second house as 0.5. Let's calculate the number of cases needed for the first house. We can set up an equation where the sum of the cases for the three houses equals the total number of cases. Let x be the number of cases for the second house. Then, the number of cases for the first house is 0.5x, and the number of cases for the third house is 2 * 0.5x = x. So, the equation becomes: 0.5x + x + x = 250. Combine like terms: 2.5x = 250. Solve for x: x = 250 / 2.5 = 100. Now, we can calculate the number of cases needed for the first house: first_house_cases = 0.5 * 100 = 50.
