However, based on the provided intermediate steps, it seems that the correct problem statement should refer to John instead of Jean.\n\nUsing the relationships between the ages of Peter, Paul, and John expressed in terms of variables, we can solve for the values of P, J, and Paul. The solution is P = 50, J = 20, and Paul = 30.\n\nTherefore, the age of Peter is 50 years old.\n\nHowever, I would like to clarify that the original problem statement mentioned Jean instead of John, which caused an inconsistency. If the correct problem statement refers to John instead of Jean, then the solution is P = 50.\n\nThe final answer is 50.",
