    "question": "The biggest waterslide at Five Flags is 300 feet long, and people slide down at 60 feet/minute. The second biggest waterslide is 240 feet long, but steeper, so people slide down at 80 feet/minute. How much longer does it take to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide?",
