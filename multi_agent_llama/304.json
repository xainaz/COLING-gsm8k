To calculate this, we need to multiply the number of hours Watson works per week by his hourly wage. Since Watson works a 10-hour shift each day, five days a week, he works a total of 10 * 5 = 50 hours per week. His weekly earnings without the bonus would be 50 * 10 = 500. The provided code already uses this value. The total amount of money Watson made without the bonus in a month is 500 * 4 = 2000. The total bonus Watson receives in a month is 300 * 4 = 1200.
