To solve for x, we need to use a method that can handle symbolic mathematics, such as the sympy library. However, since the library is not available, we can solve the equation manually. The equation can be simplified to 2x + 8 = 22. Subtracting 8 from both sides gives 2x = 14. Dividing both sides by 2 gives x = 7.
