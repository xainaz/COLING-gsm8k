        "input": "Please return only the number, with no symbols or other punctuation.It is approximately 1955 kilometers from San Diego, California to New York City, New York. If Bernice drove 325 kilometers for 4 days, how many kilometers will she still need to drive?",
        "output": "To find the number of kilometers Bernice still needs to drive, we need to subtract the distance she has already driven from the total distance.\n\nThe total distance is 1955 kilometers, and Bernice has driven 325 kilometers for 4 days. Since the number of days is not relevant to the problem, we can ignore it.\n\nFirst, we need to find the total distance Bernice has driven, which is 325 kilometers.\n\nNow, we subtract the distance Bernice has driven from the total distance:\n1955 - 325 = 1630\n\nSo, Bernice still needs to drive 1630 kilometers.\n\nThe answer is: 1630",
