    "question": "Donny can only drink water if it's at least 40 degrees. He has two mugs of water. One mug is 33 degrees. The other is an unknown temperature. If he pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug into his water bottle and one ounce from the other bottle, he is now able to drink the water.  At least how many degrees is the second bottle?",

Since Donny can only drink water if it's at least 40 degrees, the temperature of the water in the bottle after pouring must be at least 40 degrees. We know that 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug and 1 ounce from the second mug are poured into the bottle. Assuming the total volume of the water in the bottle is 5 ounces, we can set up the following equation to represent the situation: (4 * 33 + 1 * x) / 5 >= 40. This equation represents the temperature of the water in the bottle after pouring.",
