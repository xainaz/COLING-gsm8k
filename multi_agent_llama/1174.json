After that, he uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill.  Thomas then triples his money.  He then converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills.  How many 5 dollar bills does he have?",
        "output": "To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.\n\nInitially, Thomas withdraws $1000 in 20 dollar bills. To find the number of bills, we divide the total amount by the value of each bill:\n$1000 / $20 = 50 bills\n\nHe loses 10 bills while getting home, so the remaining number of bills is:\n50 - 10 = 40 bills\n\nSince each bill is worth $20, the total amount of money Thomas has is:\n40 * $20 = $800\n\nHe uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. Half of 40 bills is:\n40 / 2 = 20 bills\n\nThe amount of money he uses to pay the bill is:\n20 * $20 = $400\n\nThe remaining amount of money Thomas has is:\n$800 - $400 = $400\n\nNow, Thomas triples his money:\n$400 * 3 = $1200\n\nFinally, he converts all his bills to 5 dollar bills. To find the number of 5 dollar bills, we divide the total amount by the value of each bill:\n$1200 / $5 = 240 bills\n\nSo, Thomas has 240 five-dollar bills.",
