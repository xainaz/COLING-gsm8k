    "question": "Two apples fell out of the tree, and one of them landed on Newton's head.  Newton picked up the two apples, put one in his pocket and threw the other apple into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out of the tree.  Newton picked up these apples, put all but one in his pocket and threw the remaining one at the tree.  This caused another 6 apples to fall out of the tree.  Newton picked up all of the remaining apples and went home to make a pie.  How many apples did he bring home?",

        "output": "To solve the problem, let's break down the steps and calculate the number of apples Newton brought home.\n\nInitially, 2 apples fell out of the tree. Newton picked them up, put 1 in his pocket, and threw the other back into the tree. This caused 5 more apples to fall out. Now, Newton has 1 apple in his pocket and picks up the 5 that fell out. He puts all but 1 in his pocket and throws the remaining one at the tree. This causes 6 more apples to fall out.\n\nLet's count the apples Newton has at this point:\n- 1 apple initially put in his pocket\n- 4 apples from the 5 that fell out (he threw 1 back at the tree)\n- 6 apples that fell out after throwing the apple at the tree\n\nIn total, Newton has 1 + 4 + 6 = 11 apples.",
