        "output": "I did not have the tools to solve the step of removing the decimal point from the number 12.00. However, I can provide the solution by converting the number to an integer or by formatting the number as a string without the decimal point.\n\nHere is the corrected code:\n\n```python\n# Define the total cost of 8 pens\ntotal_cost = 12.00\n\n# Convert the total cost to an integer\ntotal_cost = int(total_cost)\n\n# Print the total cost of 8 pens without symbols or punctuation\nprint(total_cost)\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can use string formatting to remove the decimal point:\n\n```python\n# Define the total cost of 8 pens\ntotal_cost = 12.00\n\n# Format the total cost as a string without the decimal point\ntotal_cost = \"{:.0f}\".format(total_cost)\n\n# Print the total cost of 8 pens without symbols or punctuation\nprint(total_cost)\n```\n\nIn both cases, the output will be:\n\n12",
