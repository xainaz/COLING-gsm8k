        "output": "I did not have the tools to solve the problem in the previous steps. However, I can provide a solution to the problem now.\n\nTo solve the system of linear equations, we can use the `sympy` library in Python. Here's the modified code:\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# Define the variables\nc, d = sp.symbols('c d')\n\n# Define the equations\neq1 = sp.Eq(c + d, 180)\neq2 = sp.Eq(2*c + d, 304)\n\n# Solve the system of linear equations\nsolution = sp.solve((eq1, eq2), (c, d))\n\n# Print the solution\nprint(f'Number of camels: {solution[c]}')\nprint(f'Number of dromedaries: {solution[d]}')\n```\n\nWhen you run this code, it will solve the system of linear equations and print the solution. The solution will give us the number of camels and dromedaries.\n\nSince you asked to return only the number of dromedaries, the final answer is:\n\n`76`",

                "output": "I did not have the tools to solve the problem in the previous steps. However, I can provide a solution to the problem now.\n\nTo solve the system of linear equations, we can use the `sympy` library in Python. Here's the modified code:\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# Define the variables\nc, d = sp.symbols('c d')\n\n# Define the equations\neq1 = sp.Eq(c + d, 180)\neq2 = sp.Eq(2*c + d, 304)\n\n# Solve the system of linear equations\nsolution = sp.solve((eq1, eq2), (c, d))\n\n# Print the solution\nprint(f'Number of camels: {solution[c]}')\nprint(f'Number of dromedaries: {solution[d]}')\n```\n\nWhen you run this code, it will solve the system of linear equations and print the solution. The solution will give us the number of camels and dromedaries.\n\nSince you asked to return only the number of dromedaries, the final answer is:\n\n`76`",
